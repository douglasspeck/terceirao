For those who just arrived... <strong>I'm Doug!</strong>
I am a 17yo student from Brazil, which implies I am finishing my High School.<br>
As an incoming web-dev, I couldn't resist creating a <a href="www.terceirao.online" target="_blank">website</a> for so.

## What is this website *today*?

Nowadays it is pretty much a placeholder to the domain ([terceirao.online](terceirao.online)). I also used it to exercise CSS animate properties.

## What is this website *meant to be* (in the future)?

We intended to create an annuary for our class. However, the regular version wasn't enough to include everything (videos, for instance).  
That's why we decided to create a digital version for our annuary, which was the point when I started working on this idea.
